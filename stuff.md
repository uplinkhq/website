* Connecting top freelance developers with great companies in Berlin


# Intro / Pitch

Uplink is the best resource for freelance developers to discover challenging projects and new companies in Berlin!
We are not recruiting but connecting!


# Shmoo

## For developers

Are you a freelancer and tired of recruiters and headhunters contacting you via email and business networks with offers for permanent positions?
Do you find projects mostly through recommendations from other developers and wish there was a better way to discover new and interesting companies that are looking for freelancers?
Get in touch with us!
Simply tell us what technologies you'd like to work with and what your availability and hourly/daily rate is, and we will contact you when we find a company and project matching your requirements.
If you're not interested anymore or found a project, set your availability to "unavailable" and we won't contact you again.

## For companies

Are you a company in Berlin looking for freelance developers, either to supplement your existing development team or to quickly build a web or mobile app without the need to hire full-time employees?
Do you have trouble finding good candidates and does it seem like all the good freelancers are always busy?
Get in touch with us!
There are a lot of freelance developers out there looking for new challenges! Tell us a bit about your company and project and we will put you in touch with developers that are a good fit!


# What makes Uplink unique?

## For developers

You probably get contacted by recruiters via Linkedin or similar "professional networks" regularly, and most of those messages are unpersonal, boilerplate and for a position or in a city that you are not at all interested in.
Uplink is different. I (Manuel Meurr) talk to each and every company and developer personally (via Skype or a meeting) and then try to find the perfect match for their requirements. For you as a developer that means I know the technologies you work with (or want to work with in the future) and the position and daily rate range you are looking for. Your personalized weeky, bi-weekly or monthly newsletter (if you choose to receive it) only contains jobs that fit your requirements.
