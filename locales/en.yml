        headline: Our service for freelancers

        section_1:
          headline: Find new clients you love
          text: Join Uplink to find new challenging projects and get in touch with companies from Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and many other cities of Germany. Let us handle the job sourcing, so you can focus on what you do best - writing great code!

        section_2:
          headline: Skip clueless recruiters
          text: We are freelance developers ourselves, so we know that dealing with non-technical recruiters can be frustrating. Since we understand your priorities, we can make them ours, and treat your time with respect.

        section_3:
          headline: No public profile, no listings
          text: You don’t need another public profile that must be kept up-to-date, or a list of irrelevant job descriptions you have to scroll through. We keep it simple, pre-select the jobs for you, and present them to you in a personal, non-automated email.

        section_4:
          headline: A network full of possibilities
          text: Currently project aquisition is our main focus but we have many more services for freelancers in the pipeline - for example a super-simple tax service, cooperations with coworking spaces and much more!

      freelancer_testimonial:
        text: Less than one week after joining Uplink I started my first project. Loved the simplicity and straightforwardness of the whole process - a few mails, one phone call, that was it!

          text: Uplink offers instant access to hundreds of mobile, frontend, backend, and fullstack developers. Whether you need someone next week or six months from now, for just a few days or ongoing, we can help you find the right candidate!

        section_2:
          headline: Personal introductions
          text: We won’t send you a dozen barely relevant profiles and leave you to figure out who can really do the job. Instead, we take our time to understand your requirements and introduce you to the one or two candidates who are the best fit for you.

        section_3:
          headline: Vetted professionals
          text: We work exclusively with senior developers who have years of freelancing experience, and we vet each freelancer personally so you don’t have to. You can trust that every candidate recommended by us will live up to your highest standards.

        section_4:
          headline: We are developers, not recruiters
          text: Being developers ourselves, we understand your tech stack and development needs. Non-technical recruiters have to try to find candidates with a list of requirements they don’t understand, which is inefficient and error-prone.

      company_testimonial:
        text: Through Uplink we found three freelancers exactly when we needed them. Each one was a great fit and was available immediately. After trying out several other options in the past, this was the most hassle-free and cost-effective way for us to find qualified freelancers!

        step_1:

          text: Simply %{link} and tell us a bit about yourself, your experience as a developer and your motivations.
          link_text: contact us via the form below

        step_2:
          headline: Get set up

        step_3:
          headline: Get hired
          text: When we know you’re available, we will contact you via email when a new project comes in that we think you’ll love. Simple as that!

      benefits:
        headline: What makes us great?

        section_1:
          headline: Find new clients you love
          text: Join Uplink to find new challenging projects and get in touch with companies from Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and many other cities of Germany. Whether you’re looking for the intimate, dynamic feel of a startup or the hustle and bustle of an agency or large company, you can find it through Uplink. Let us handle the job sourcing, so you can focus on what you do best - writing great code!

        section_2:
          headline: Skip clueless recruiters
          text: We are freelance developers ourselves, so we know that dealing with non-technical recruiters can be frustrating. Since Uplink is first and foremost a service for you - the freelancers - we understand your priorities and make them ours. This means we can honestly tell you about trickier customers or a project’s potential pitfalls. We are on your side and treat your time and attention with respect.

        section_3:
          headline: No public profile, no listings
          text: You don’t need another public profile that must be kept up-to-date, or a list of irrelevant job descriptions you have to scroll through. With a little work done by us personally, not by an algorithm, we can save all our members a lot of time and frustration. We keep it simple, pre-select the jobs for you, and present them to you in a personal, non-automated email.

        section_4:
          headline: Local beats global
          text: While some companies already work with freelancers from all over the world, most of them are looking for "local" developers - they don't necessarily have to live in the same city, and can often work flexibly and remotely, but they should be available for meetings and workshops at the client's office. Just tell us in which cities you are available to work or meet with clients!

        section_5:
          headline: Timing is everything
          text: Are you busy in a project right now but already want to line up the next one? We know what a hassle it is to try to find a new project exactly when you need it. Just tell us when you are available again and we can negotiate with interested companies on your behalf and let them know they might want to postpone (or advance) their projects to have you on their team.

        section_6:
          headline: We know what you’re worth
          text: Negotiating a rate with a potential client can be the most stressful part of the whole project. This is why we ask the client about their budget early on in the process, and of course only offer you projects that match your personal rate as well. This way you know that you and the client are playing in the same ballpark before you even talk to them.

        headline: Find an expert for any technology
        text: |
          No matter what programming language or framework you use, through Uplink you can find an experienced developer who can hit the ground running!

          Our members include experts in:
        suffix: ...and many more technologies!

      benefits:
        headline: What makes us great?

        section_1:
          headline: Let us be your network
          text: Uplink offers instant access to hundreds of mobile, frontend, backend, and fullstack developers. If your perfect match is not yet among them, we make our network work for you and find them. Whether you need someone next week or six months from now, remotely or on-site, for just a few days or on an ongoing basis, we can help you find the right candidate!

        section_2:
          headline: Personal introductions
          text: We won’t send you a dozen barely relevant profiles and leave you to figure out who can really do the job. Instead, we take our time to understand your requirements and introduce you to the one or two candidates who are the best fit for you. We strongly believe this process should not be automated by simply matching up client requirements and developer skills.

        section_3:
          headline: Vetted professionals
          text: We work exclusively with senior developers who have years of freelancing experience, and we vet each freelancer personally so you don’t have to. Fluent English, professional communication, and timely delivery are just a few of the qualities each of our freelancers has. You can trust that every candidate recommended by us will live up to your highest standards.

        section_4:
          headline: We are developers, not recruiters
          text: Being developers ourselves, we can take our time to really understand your tech stack and help you figure out what skills a developer needs to work out for you. Non-technical recruiters have to make do with a list of requirements they don’t understand, and try to find candidates by simply comparing this list to the candidate’s profile, which is inefficient and error-prone.

        section_5:
          headline: On-site or remote
          text: Our members understand that it's often easier for clients to work with them on-site at their office. Nevertheless you can increase your chances for a good match if you allow the developer to work remotely partly or completely. This gives the freelancer the freedom to do their best work for you and also increases the likelihood for a long-term cooperation.

        section_6:
          headline: Transparency wins
          text: One of the biggest requests of IT freelancers for recruiters is more transparency - if it's missing between the freelancer and recruiter, the client relationship starts off on shaky ground as well. We therefore try to be as transparent as possible to the clients as well as the freelancers, starting with our pricing and extending to all other parts of our business.

      text: |
        I have been working as a freelance developer in Berlin since 2008. Every time I found myself looking for a new project, it struck me as odd that there was no efficient and straightforward way to find out which companies were presently looking for a freelance developer with my qualifications.

        Outside of my personal network of friends and colleagues, the only other options were recruiters, who often had no background as developers, or job boards, which mostly focus on permanent positions.

        **This was my inspiration for Uplink - a simpler and more personal way for freelance developers to connect with the companies that need them.**
